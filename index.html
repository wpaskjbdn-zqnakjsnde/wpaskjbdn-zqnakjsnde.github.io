            Hi, my name is Ajinkya Malhotra and I am currently pursuing M.S. in Computer Science at Texas A & M and I am actively looking for SDE Internship for Fall 2023.
			<br/>
			A little bit about myself, I attained my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science degree from California State University - Sacramento(CSUS) at the end of Spring 2019.
			After graduating from CSUS, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Esurance(now known as All-State) for 10 months, and for the past 2 years, I was working as a Serverless Cloud Engineer at Amazon Web Service (AWS).
			<br/>
			While my core programming language is Java and have expertise in many serverless AWS services, I am constantly evolving my skills and pushing myself to learn more technologies and languages.
			<br/>
			I love every aspect of Computer Science, whether it's debugging a complex problem or writing code to solve a complex problem. I want to build upon my existing skillsets by creating software that has a worldwide impact.
          </p>

            Putting my "search engine optimization" hat on. Created this webpage in the hopes that it scores highest for the query <strong>wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde</strong>. As of today (March 23) there are no hits for this query on Google. Based on the discussions in my ISR class about search engine ranking algorithms and several other factors that may impact a page's rank, I will be using the same to get a higher rank for my webpage. My goal is to use this knowledge to promote my own page to the top of the list.

Please read the discussion of "white hat" versus "black hat" SEO over at Wikipedia. The only requirement is that somewhere in the page (possibly in the html) you must include your name or some other way for us to identify you

          <p>
            I want to work in the software Industry! Rise the ranks and build up a name for myself as an Engineer.
			<p></p>
			Primarily looking for Experience in the industry. As an engineer, a lot of fields in software appeal to me. But distributed and computings calls to me. My field of interest lies in the Software and Cloud division, so an Industry encompassing them would lie in the perfect zone of interest and passion.  Currently at the nexus of my career, I feel that my educational background and project experience have reinforced my will to join the industry. I have a bit of experience working with others to achieve a common goal. I’m aware of the work culture and I would fit right in. I’m well rounded and holistic in nature.
			<p></p>But at the end of the day, I specialize in "just getting the job done" no matter what.
